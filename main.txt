Finished HackReactor's Twittler assignment.
Worked on HackReactor's Recurison assignment. Was able to finish stringifyJSON.js and getElementsByClassName.js. Still slogging through parse.JSON.js. 

During my time on the treadmill when I exercise, I've gone through [JavaScript Understanding the Weird Parts](https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/learn/v4/overview). It goes through a lot of the Recursion topics. 

I realized the personal project I'm working needs an Auth process, so decided to jump in to the MERN stack. I started going through [this Udemy React course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-web-app-developer-course).

HackReactor starts in two weeks.

To focus on next week:

* Finish HR's Recursion
* Finish the React Course
* Keep going through JS The Weird Parts

Finished HackReactor's Underbar and Koans assignment. Need to do 'toy problems' daily to keep up to date.

Started working on HackReactor's Twittler assignment. Rusty on Jquery and CSS. I added Bootstrap4 to style it. 

Reviewed JS ES6. Need to start using the new methods.

To focus on next week:

* Koans Extra Credit
* HR's deadline 3 (Recursion)
* Flesh out River website with Bootstrap
