Finished HackReactor's Underbar and Koans assignment. Need to do 'toy problems' daily to keep up to date.

Started working on HackReactor's Twittler assignment. Rusty on Jquery and CSS. I added Bootstrap4 to style it. 

Reviewed JS ES6. Need to start using the new methods.

To focus on next week:

* Koans Extra Credit
* HR's deadline 3 (Recursion)
* Flesh out River website with Bootstrap
